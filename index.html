Description

Beth Lipman’s contemporary work, Mixed Fruit Centerpiece (III), is a 2 foot towering arrangement of glass bananas, apples, grapes, and snails, supported by a decorative glass bowl. The bowl has an inch wide foot, a smooth body, and a decorative rim. Leaves and grapes explode from the top of it, beneath the rest of the mass. At the top sits a large vertically positioned piece of fruit, allowing the entire piece to take on the rough shape of a spruce tree. A few inches away from the foot of the bowl, there is a fallen, unidentifiable piece of fruit. It is unclear if the fallen fruit is an intentional element, or a sign of damage to the piece. The overall appearance of the work demonstrates Lipman’s incredible skill as a craftsman.

The object is estimated to weigh 15 to 35 lbs, and stand 2’ in height by .8’ in circumference.



Manufacturing Techniques

This piece was designed and manufactured by Beth Lipman. She uses a combination of free-blowing, sculpting, and gluing to create an overwhelming effect. The glass is colorless and clear.



Historical Significance

This piece is a part of a site-specific installation called “After You’re Gone,” designed by Lipman to evoke mortality, consumerism, materiality, and temporality. The installation included multiple glass creations, including bowls, cups, vases, platters, bouquets of flowers, chairs, and towers of fruit like Mixed Fruit Centerpiece (III).
The imagery of fruit and snails is a nod to the motifs of traditional European still-life painting. The 17th century was known as the “golden age” of still-life painting, especially in Europe. The first still-lives, in the Netherlands, depicted skulls, candles, and hourglasses to symbolize nature’s cycle of life and death. It became popular to evoke nature’s cycles by depicting fruits and flowers from all four seasons. The still-life was appropriated by a growing wealthy middle class, to serve as a means of showing off and documenting one’s personal abundance of wealth. Fruit was a popular subject during the rise of secularism in the 16th and 17th centuries.

True to this era of painting, Lipman makes full use of symbolism with the imagery that she selects. Her use of snails speaks of themes of decay, echoed by a feeling of ghostliness throughout the installation. “After You’re Gone” is a room overflowing with beautifully arranged near life-sized fruits, but she depicts it using only colorless glass.

The fallen piece of fruit may be a nod to the intentional arrangement of traditional European still life paintings. It also reminds the viewer of the ephemeral nature of the chosen subject matter.

It is unclear exactly what significance this installation is intended to have, but it certainly serves to provoke a conversation about the fleeting indulgences of life and the effect of concentrated wealth on the world.
